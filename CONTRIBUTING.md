## Commit Rules

- Use imperative mood for commit messages
- Format: `type(scope): message`
- Types:
  - feat: new feature
  - fix: bug fix
  - docs: documentation
  - style: formatting, no code change
  - refactor: code restructuring
  - test: adding or fixing tests
  - chore: maintenance
- Keep commits small and focused
- Run tests and linters before pushing
